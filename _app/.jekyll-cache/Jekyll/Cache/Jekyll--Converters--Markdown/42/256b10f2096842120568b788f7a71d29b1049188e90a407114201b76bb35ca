I"É<p>Almace Scaffolding now migrates from Less to Sass, this may make your existing projects non-upgradable, it needs quite a lot of work for you to do the migration if you use a custom theme that itâ€™s powered by Less preprocessor. You have to compare your existing projects to <a href="https://github.com/sparanoid/almace-scaffolding/pull/85">this Pull Request</a> side to side to make sure every change you made are synced correctly.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re a casual blogger only change some color variables for your default theme, Curtana in this situation, thatâ€™s good, you can migrate to v2 easier: just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ grunt update</code>.</p>

<p>You should also migrate your own styles in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user.less</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_user.scss</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_varaibles.scss</code>. Due to Sass limitation, I donâ€™t have variable hoisting features like native CSS or Less at hand, so I have to create two user-defined stylesheets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/_scss/_variables.scss</code> - This file should contain only Sass variables defined in theme Curtana. It will be loaded at the topmost of theme stylesheet <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app.scss</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/_scss/_user.scss</code> - where users create style customization.</li>
</ul>

<p>From 2.0.0, Almace Scaffolding still has the ability to use Less with Grunt.js, however, itâ€™s wise to write your theme in Sass for better future compatibility.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to stick with the Less version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>v1.1.11 will be the last version that supports Less.</li>
  <li>Less version of theme Curtana will be available as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amsf/amsf-curtana-less</code>.</li>
</ul>
